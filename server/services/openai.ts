Original Resume Content (WITH DETAILED EXPERIENCE BULLETS):
${resumeContent}

Contact Information:
${JSON.stringify(contactInfo, null, 2)}

Job Analysis Results:
${JSON.stringify(jobAnalysis, null, 2)}

Resume Analysis:
${JSON.stringify(resumeAnalysis, null, 2)}

MANDATORY INSTRUCTION: The original resume contains detailed experience sections with 6-8 bullet points per job, including quantified achievements like:
- "Architected and managed high-availability SQL Server environments (2016–2022) for critical healthcare applications"
- "Led migration of on-premises databases to AWS, utilizing AWS RDS and DMS, enhancing scalability and reducing infrastructure costs"
- "Implemented AlwaysOn Availability Groups and Failover Clustering, achieving seamless failover capabilities"
- "Optimized database performance using Extended Events, Query Store, and DMVs, improving query execution times"

YOU MUST EXTRACT THESE EXISTING BULLETS AND INCLUDE THEM IN THE EXPERIENCE SECTION. DO NOT CREATE EMPTY JOB ENTRIES.

STEP 5 - TRUTHFULNESS LADDER:
Apply strict truthfulness when adding JD keywords:
- HANDS-ON experience → Include in Experience bullets with metrics
- FAMILIAR WITH / exposure → Include in Skills with "Familiar with" phrasing  
- NOT TRUE → Do not include (no inflation)

STEP 6 - REQUIRED COVERAGE:
Ensure resume mentions (or marks as familiar) every bucket the JD stresses:
- Operational duties (on-call, self-serve tools, documentation, monitoring, backups, audits)
- Environment specifics (Windows/Linux, virtualization, remote/location, travel/onsite)
- Secondary data stores (MySQL/PostgreSQL if JD prefers - mark as familiar if light)

STEP 7 - SCORING RUBRIC (100 points total, show your math):
- Core Tech & Platforms (35 pts) - versions/stacks, OS, HA/DR
- Responsibilities (25 pts) - operational work matching JD
- Tools/Automation (15 pts) - PowerShell, Git, schedulers, observability
- Adjacent Data Stores (10 pts) - MySQL/Postgres/EHR systems  
- Compliance/Industry (10 pts) - HIPAA, audits, security
- Logistics & Culture (5 pts) - travel, remote, communication

Return detailed score breakdown with evidence sentences.

STEP 8 - SAFETY CHECKS:
- If JD is EHR-admin but tailored as DBA, redo with EHR duties
- Verify role archetype alignment
- Ensure truthful content only

STEP 9 - AUTOMATICALLY APPLY MICRO-EDITS:
Identify specific requirements from the job posting and AUTOMATICALLY ADD corresponding bullet points to enhance the tailored content. Do NOT just list them as suggestions - INTEGRATE them directly into the experience section where appropriate:

For job-specific requirements, ADD these types of enhanced bullets:
- Oracle/Multi-DB roles: "Administered Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL environments with 99.9% uptime across distributed enterprise systems"
- ServiceNow integration: "Utilized ServiceNow for incident management, change control, and SLA adherence in enterprise environments"
- Technical Leadership: "Led cross-functional technical teams in critical incident response and database architecture decisions"
- Project Management: "Collaborated with Program Managers and Engineering teams on mission-critical database infrastructure projects"
- Performance Optimization: "Implemented advanced performance monitoring, query optimization, and capacity planning for high-volume database systems"
- Documentation & Process: "Established comprehensive operational procedures, runbooks, and database configuration documentation"
- Compliance & Security: "Ensured HIPAA/SOX compliance through audit trail implementation and data encryption strategies"
- Automation: "Developed PowerShell automation scripts for routine maintenance, health checks, and deployment processes"
- Cloud Migration: "Architected and executed cloud migration strategies using AWS RDS, Azure SQL, and multi-cloud deployment models"
- Disaster Recovery: "Designed and tested comprehensive disaster recovery procedures with RTO/RPO targets under 15 minutes"

CRITICAL: These are not suggestions - AUTOMATICALLY incorporate relevant bullets based on the specific job requirements into the experience achievements arrays.

STEP 10 - GENERATE OPTIMIZED CONTENT:

DYNAMIC JOB ANALYSIS:
Based on the job posting analysis, identify and address the specific requirements, technologies, and company context from THIS job posting. Do not use generic requirements from other jobs.

SPECIFIC JOB REQUIREMENTS TO ADDRESS:
Extract the actual requirements from the job analysis provided and tailor accordingly.

Please respond with a JSON object containing:
- contact: Use the REAL contact information from the provided contactInfo object - never use placeholders like "Professional Name". Use the actual name, email, phone, etc. from the contactInfo. For the title field, use the EXACT job title from the job posting (e.g., "Senior Database Administrator - Azure SQL & Multi-Cloud Data Platforms") to show perfect role alignment.
- summary: Professional summary that MATCHES THE EXACT JOB LEVEL and requirements from the job posting. For modern data platform roles, lead with cloud technologies (Azure SQL, Snowflake, multi-cloud). For traditional DBA roles, lead with SQL Server. Emphasize the specific technologies and responsibilities mentioned in the job posting. DO NOT include location preferences or willingness to work in specific locations like "Open to a fully on-site role in Camden, NJ"
- experience: Array of experience objects with this MANDATORY format:
  [
    {
      "title": "Sr. Database Administrator",
      "company": "UnitedHealth", 
      "duration": "October 2020 - Present",
      "achievements": [
        "Architected and managed high-availability SQL Server environments (2016–2022) for critical healthcare applications, ensuring optimal performance and uptime",

        "Optimized database performance using Extended Events, Query Store, and DMVs, improving query execution times",
        "Collaborated with InfoSec to deploy TDE, Always Encrypted, Data Masking, and Row-Level Security for HIPAA compliance"
      ]
    }
  ]
  CRITICAL: Use "title", "company", "duration", and "achievements" fields. Extract and preserve ALL existing bullet points from the original resume.
- skills: Include EXACT job posting terms and requirements found in the job analysis, such as specific technologies, methodologies, and qualifications mentioned
- keywords: Focus on operational terms from job posting
- certifications: Array of certification strings from original resume (e.g., ["Microsoft Certified: Azure Database Administrator Associate", "Oracle Database 12c Administrator Certified Professional"]).

- **Data Pipelines**: Include "automated data pipelines", "ELT/ETL", "fit-for-purpose data pipelines"

These keywords are critical for achieving 90%+ ATS scores and must be present in the final resume.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Avoid overusing "familiar"** - use variety with terms like "Experience with", "Working knowledge of", "Background in", "Exposure to", "Proficient in", "Hands-on experience with"
2. **Match job title exactly** - Use the exact job title from posting in the contact.title field
3. **Technology prioritization** - For cloud/data platform roles, emphasize modern stack (Snowflake, dbt, Airflow, Azure SQL specifics) over traditional SQL Server
4. **Industry alignment** - Adjust language for company context (financial services, healthcare, enterprise, etc.)
5. **Role evolution** - Traditional DBA → Cloud DBA → Data Platform Engineer → Multi-Cloud Data Engineer based on job requirements`;

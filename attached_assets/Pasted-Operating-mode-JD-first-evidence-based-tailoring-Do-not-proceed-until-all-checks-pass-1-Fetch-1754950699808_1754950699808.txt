Operating mode: “JD-first, evidence-based tailoring.” Do not proceed until all checks pass.
1) Fetch & verify the JD (stop if weak)
Pull the JD from the pasted text (prefer pasted text over URL).
Compute: char_count, word_count, and the first 500 chars.
Stop & ask me if ANY is true:
char_count < 3,000 OR top keywords don’t include at least 10 from the JD (role, stack, duties, logistics).
Page looks generic (e.g., cookie banner, “apply now,” nav items instead of duties).
2) Role archetype check (prevents “DBA vs EHR” mistakes)
Classify the JD into one archetype before tailoring:
SQL Server DBA (e.g., AlwaysOn, AGs, indexing, backups, perf tuning)
EHR Administrator (EHR names, HIPAA, training, audit trails, vendor coordination, templates/forms)
Data Engineer, SRE/DevOps, BI/Analytics, etc.
If your extracted keywords and examples don’t agree with the chosen archetype, stop and ask.
3) Keyword buckets (with synonyms)
Extract the top 30 JD keywords and group them:
Core Tech (e.g., SQL Server 2016/2019; AlwaysOn ≈ “AGs”, “availability groups”, “clustering”)
Responsibilities (e.g., performance tuning; “build self-serve tools”; “on-call rotation”; “user training”)
Ecosystem/Tools (PowerShell, Git, job schedulers, EHR names, ERWin)
Ops/Compliance (HIPAA, audits, security, backups)
Logistics (remote states, travel %, onsite)
Soft skills/culture (communication, documentation)
Maintain a small synonym map (expand, don’t overfit).
Examples:
AlwaysOn ⇔ AGs ⇔ Availability Groups ⇔ Clustered HA
EHR ⇔ EMR; Audit Trails ⇔ Access Logs ⇔ HIPAA audit
Self-serve tools ⇔ self-service scripts ⇔ developer tooling ⇔ internal utilities
4) Truthfulness ladder
When adding JD keywords:
Hands-on → put in Experience bullets with metrics.
Familiar with / exposure → put in Skills “Familiar with” or lighter phrasing.
Not true → do not include. No inflation.
5) Required coverage (add lines if truthful)
Before scoring, ensure the resume mentions (or explicitly marks as familiar) every bucket the JD stresses:
Duties that are operational (e.g., on-call, self-serve tools, documentation/runbooks, monitor/measure, backups/security, audits).
Environment specifics (Windows/Linux, virtualization, remote/work location, travel/onsite).
Secondary data stores (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL) if the JD prefers them—mark as familiar if light.
6) Scoring rubric (100 pts, show your math)
Core Tech & Platforms (35) – versions/stacks named (e.g., SQL Server 2016/2019), OS, HA/DR.
Responsibilities (25) – doing the work the JD lists (monitor/tune, backups, self-serve, on-call, docs).
Tools/Automation (15) – PowerShell, Git, schedulers, observability.
Adjacent Data Stores (10) – MySQL/Postgres/EHR systems as applicable.
Compliance/Industry (10) – HIPAA, audits, security.
Logistics & Culture (5) – travel/onsite, remote eligibility, collaboration/communication.
Return a table: each line = bucket, points earned/possible, and the resume sentences that satisfied it.
7) Safety checks (prevent bad outputs)
If the JD appears EHR-admin but the resume is tailored as DBA, redo with EHR duties (training, access reviews, vendor upgrades, audit logs, data quality).
If URL fetch failed or the content is JS-rendered, ask me to paste the JD. Never guess.
8) Deliverables & filenames
Output ATS and Core versions; keep everything truthful.
Filenames:
<Base>-<Company>-<RoleShort>-<JobID or City>-<YYYYMMDD>-ATS.docx/.pdf
<Base>-<Company>-<RoleShort>-<JobID or City>-<YYYYMMDD>-Core.docx/.pdf
Also output JD-coverage-<Company>-<RoleShort>-<YYYYMMDD>.txt with:
Top 30 JD keywords (with synonyms when used)
Matched vs missing lists
Final score with bucket breakdown
The first 500 chars of JD used (for audit)
9) Micro-edits to apply when those topics exist in the JD
Use one-liners like:
“Built self-serve DBA tools (PowerShell/T-SQL) so devs can run health checks/restores/perf baselines.”
“Participated in 24×7 on-call rotation; restored service within SLA.”
“Maintained runbooks/SOPs for recurring DBA tasks.”
“Familiar: MySQL/PostgreSQL for minor components.”
For EHR roles: “Provisioned EHR users/roles; audit trails; vendor-coordinated upgrades; HIPAA reviews.”
10) Final sanity echo
At the end, print:
JD archetype, top keywords, missing high-weight items (if any), and why (e.g., not truthful).
3 suggested micro-edits (truthful) that would raise the score next time.

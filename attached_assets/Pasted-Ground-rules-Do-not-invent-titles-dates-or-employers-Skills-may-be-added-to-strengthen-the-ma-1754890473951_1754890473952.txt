Ground rules
* Do not invent titles, dates, or employers.
* Skills may be added to strengthen the match (even if not in my resume) 
    * Do not claim past achievements using newly added skills.

CRITICAL HARD RULES (NEVER OVERRIDE):
* FIXED RESUME HEADLINE: The main resume headline/title MUST ALWAYS be exactly:
    "Senior SQL Server Database Administrator / SQL Developer"
    - DO NOT replace this with the job posting title
    - The job posting title may be mentioned in the Professional Summary, but NOT as the main headline
    - NO separate "Target: Company - Job Title" banner at the top
* 2-PAGE MAXIMUM with smart trimming:
    - Resume MUST fit within 2 pages using normal ATS-safe formatting
    - When trimming is needed to fit 2 pages:
        KEEP (fully detailed):
        - Most recent 2-3 roles with full, strong, quantified bullets
        - Strongest bullets about: performance tuning (indexes, Query Store, DMVs, Extended Events), 
          HA/DR (AlwaysOn AG, Failover Clustering, log shipping, mirroring), 
          backups/restore (Ola scripts, RPO/RTO), cloud (Azure/AWS, migrations, RDS, Azure SQL/MI),
          production support and on-call incident response
        TRIM/REMOVE first:
        - Older roles beyond the most recent 2-3 positions
        - Repetitive bullets (generic "managed SQL Server" or "collaborated with developers")
        - Generic responsibilities that don't add new detail
    - NEVER invent or alter titles, dates, or employers when trimming—only remove or condense bullets
* NO "Target: Company - Job Title" banner or header line anywhere in the resume
JD input (URL or paste)
* Accept either a job URL or pasted JD text.
* If both exist, use pasted text.
* Always show a parsed JD preview 
Header / contact
* Read my name, city/state, phone, email, LinkedIn from my base resume and place them at the top of the resume body (not only in the Word header). If any are missing, ask me.
* Title MUST be the fixed headline: "Senior SQL Server Database Administrator / SQL Developer" (never use job posting title here)
ATS Score + Match % (in summary, not on resume)
* Produce an ATS Scorecard in tailoring_summary.md:
    * Overall Match % (0–100) with weights: must-haves 60%, preferred 20%, keyword coverage 15%, format compliance 5%.
    * Coverage matrix: each must-have → Yes / Partial / Missing.
    * Keyword coverage: exact + fuzzy synonyms (e.g., Always On AG ≈ AlwaysOn/HADR; Query Store ≈ DMVs/Perf tuning).
    * Top gaps & stretch adds: list the JD skills you added as Familiar (Learning).
Resume formatting
* ATS-safe: no tables in the body, standard fonts, simple bullets, ≤2 pages, consistent dates (YYYY–MM).
* Prioritize DBA themes: SQL Server 2016–2022, T-SQL, performance tuning (indexes/Query Store/DMVs), Always On AG (HA/DR), backups/restore (Ola), security (TDE/RLS/DDM/Auditing), Azure SQL/MI, PowerShell automation.
* Quantify using existing facts (latency %, uptime, RPO/RTO, DB sizes, server counts).
Outputs
* tailored_resume.docx + tailored_resume.pdf
* tailoring_summary.md (parsed JD, Match %, coverage matrix, keyword map, gaps & stretch adds)
* If scraping fails, stop and ask me to paste the JD.
Nice to add (optional but helpful)
* Two variants:
    * Core (only skills already in resume)
    * Stretch (adds JD skills as Familiar/Learning)
* Synonym map baked in:
    * HA/DR: Always On, HADR, AG, Failover, Log Shipping, FCI.
    * Perf: Query Store, DMVs, XE (Extended Events), Index tuning, SARGability.
    * Security: TDE, RLS, DDM, Auditing, Row-level security, Encryption at rest.
    * Backup/Restore: Ola Hallengren, RPO/RTO, Recovery models, Point-in-time.
    * Azure: Azure SQL DB, Managed Instance, Elastic pools, Failover groups.
* Keyword density guardrail: weave keywords naturally; avoid obvious stuffing.
* Easy-Apply helper: output a short, 4–6 line “About me for Easy Apply” snippet.

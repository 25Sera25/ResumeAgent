What to build next (practical, high-impact)
1) Application Follow-Up Copilot (start here)
Why: Fastest ROI. Keeps you top-of-mind and fixes the “black hole”.
MVP:
Add a followups table: job_id, due_at, type('1w','2w','thank_you'), status('pending','sent','skipped').
Endpoint: POST /followups/schedule (sets 1-week + 2-week reminders on submit).
UI: “Schedule follow-ups” toggle on the job card; a small queue view.
Templates (LLM):
“1-week check-in”
“2-week nudge with value add”
“post-interview thank-you (STAR recap)”
Delivery: don’t auto-send; generate draft emails you copy-paste (keeps cost & risk low).
Metric: show “follow-ups sent vs. interview callbacks”.
2) Warm-Intro / Outreach Generator
Why: Referrals beat cold applies.
MVP:
Field on job card: contacts[] (name, role, LinkedIn URL, relationship).
Button: “Generate outreach” → LLM drafts 3 variants: recruiter, employee, hiring manager.
Add a “Sequence” (Day 0, Day 4, Day 10) with a checkbox tracker.
No scraping; you paste names—keeps it simple & safe.
3) AI Interview Coach (lite)
Why: You already get interviews; this makes you perform like your ATS score.
MVP:
From each tailored resume + JD, generate:
6 technical questions (SQL internals, HA/DR, backup/RPO/RTO, indexing, perf tools).
4 behavioral STAR prompts tailored to the JD.
UI: single page with record button (browser mic/camera) and a timer (60–90s).
Feedback (cheap): text-only rubric (“mentioned X/Y keywords; too long; missing RPO/RTO numbers”). No vision/voice analysis needed initially.
4) Skills Gap Radar (rolling dashboard)
Why: Skills-based hiring is real; lets you target learning.
MVP:
Aggregate required keywords across saved jobs; show “Missing in ≥ N jobs”.
One-click “Add to Learning Plan” list with links you paste (MS Learn, official docs).
Autocomplete “Skills” on your profile; when you mark a skill as “Working/Proficient”, the generator can include it truthfully next time.
5) Salary & Market Intel (lightweight)
Why: Better targeting + better negotiation.
MVP:
Manual entry fields on job card: posted range, location, onsite/remote.
Show a simple band: “Your target ask: midpoint + 5–10% if you meet all must-haves.”
Template: “negotiation opener” + “counter-offer” drafted by LLM.
6) Personal Brand Mini-Portfolio (auto-assembled)
Why: Differentiator; great post-interview leave-behind.
MVP:
From your bullet wins, generate 1–2 case studies (“Reduced query time 60%”, “Met RTO/RPO via AG + copy-only backups”).
Export as single-page PDF (no CMS site yet). Link it in outreach or thank-you.
